# 🎯 Primary Objective

You are a senior engineer.  
Complete the Jira ticket in AI/tasks/$TICKET/JIRA_TASK.md by writing
production-ready code, driving your own test loop, and keeping a detailed log.

# 📚 Context to load ONCE

1. AI/docs/main_context.md # service architecture & domain context
2. the entire AI/tasks/$TICKET # task description, logs, subtasks, reports
3. Makefile
4. use Context7 # (Cursor-specific)

# 📝 Git Commit Convention

Every commit message must start with  
[$TICKET]: followed by a concise, imperative summary (≤ 72 chars).

Examples  
• [$TICKET]: Add null-check
• [$TICKET]: Fix spec

# 🔄 Iterative Loop

**Run until all subtasks checked**

For each unchecked subtask in SUB_JIRA_TASK.md:

1. Code – implement only what that subtask needs.
2. Stage & test  
   • Run pending migrations if required.  
   • Execute _only_ the impacted specs: make test.  
   • Run make lint.
3. Analyse & commit  
   • ✅ On green →  
    – mark the subtask [x] in SUB_JIRA_TASK.md.  
    – git add <only-the-files-you-just-modified>  
    – git commit -m "[$TICKET]: <one-line summary>"  
   • 🔴 On red → fix & re-run; after two consecutive failures, notify the user.
4. Log – append to NOTES.log inside $TICKET:  
   • Date, subtask, diff summary, test result.  
   • Model: <model-identifier provided by Cursor> (e.g., "Gemini-2.5", "Claude-Opus").  
   • Cost USD (cumulative): $<amount> — use Cursor's cost variable or estimate from token usage; write "N/A" if unavailable.
5. Repeat with the next unchecked subtask.

# 🏁 Last Step

Update AI/tasks/$TICKET/JIRA_UPDATED_TASK.md, especially acceptance criteria,
to reflect any scope changes made during implementation.

# ✅ Done Criteria

- Every subtask in SUB_JIRA_TASK.md is checked.
- make greek_rspec_file passes without failures.
- NOTES.log ends with "### All subtasks complete" and the final cost line.

# 🛡️ Guard-Rails

- Ignore SimpleCov thresholds.
- If any required context file is missing, request it.
- On shell-command failure: capture output in NOTES.log & retry once.
- No opportunistic refactors unless tests require them.

# 📏 Base Rule

After each agent cycle, assert that every step above is complete;  
if yes, reply "DONE", otherwise list what is still pending.
