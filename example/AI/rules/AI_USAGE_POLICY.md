# AI Usage Policy

## Purpose and Scope
This policy establishes guidelines for the responsible and effective use of AI tools in our development workflow. It applies to all team members using AI-assisted development tools including but not limited to ChatGPT, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and custom AI integrations.

## Core Principles

### 🎯 **Human-Centric Approach**
- AI is a tool to augment human intelligence, not replace it
- Final decisions and code ownership remain with human developers
- Critical thinking and code review are mandatory for all AI-generated content
- Human oversight is required for all security-critical and business-logic code

### 🔒 **Security and Compliance**
- Never share proprietary code, customer data, or sensitive information with external AI services
- Use only approved AI tools that comply with our security standards
- Implement additional security reviews for AI-generated code in critical paths
- Report security concerns related to AI usage immediately

### 📊 **Quality Assurance**
- All AI-generated code must meet the same quality standards as human-written code
- Comprehensive testing is required for all AI-assisted implementations
- Performance and scalability implications must be considered
- Documentation and maintainability standards apply equally to AI-generated code

## Approved AI Tools

### ✅ **Approved for General Use**
- **Cursor**: Code completion, generation, and refactoring
- **ChatGPT**: Problem solving, documentation, and planning
- **GitHub Copilot**: Code suggestions and completion
- **Diff Critic**: Automated code review and analysis

### ⚠️ **Approved with Restrictions**
- **External AI APIs**: Only for non-sensitive code analysis
- **Open-source AI models**: Require security review before use
- **Experimental AI tools**: Must be approved by team lead

### ❌ **Not Approved**
- AI tools that require uploading proprietary code to external servers
- Unauthorized AI services without security evaluation
- AI tools that don't provide adequate privacy controls

## Usage Guidelines

### 🚀 **Development Workflow Integration**
1. **Pre-coding Phase**: Use AI for task analysis and planning
2. **Development Phase**: Leverage AI for code generation and problem-solving
3. **Review Phase**: Employ AI-assisted code review tools
4. **Documentation Phase**: Utilize AI for documentation generation and updates

### 📝 **Documentation Requirements**
- Document AI usage in merge request descriptions
- Specify which AI tools were used and for what purpose
- Note any significant manual modifications to AI-generated code
- Update team knowledge base with effective AI usage patterns

### 🔍 **Quality Control**
- Mandatory self-review using AI/code-review process
- Human validation of all AI-generated business logic
- Performance testing for AI-optimized code
- Security review for authentication, authorization, and data handling code

## Best Practices

### 💡 **Effective AI Interaction**
- Provide clear, specific context using AI/docs structure
- Use established prompting patterns from AI/prompts
- Iterate and refine AI-generated solutions
- Cross-reference AI suggestions with project standards

### 🏗️ **Architecture and Design**
- Use AI to explore design alternatives
- Validate AI architectural suggestions against team standards
- Ensure AI-generated code follows established patterns
- Maintain consistency with existing codebase structure

### 🧪 **Testing and Validation**
- Generate comprehensive test cases with AI assistance
- Validate AI-generated tests for completeness and accuracy
- Use AI for test data generation and edge case identification
- Ensure test coverage meets project standards

## Prohibited Uses

### 🚫 **Strictly Forbidden**
- Sharing proprietary algorithms or business logic with external AI services
- Using AI to generate code for security-critical functions without human review
- Copying AI-generated code without understanding its functionality
- Bypassing established code review processes for AI-generated code
- Using AI to make decisions about system architecture without team consultation

## Monitoring and Compliance

### 📊 **Usage Tracking**
- Track AI tool usage and effectiveness metrics
- Monitor code quality trends for AI-assisted development
- Assess time savings and productivity improvements
- Document and share successful AI usage patterns

### 🔄 **Regular Reviews**
- Monthly assessment of AI tool effectiveness
- Quarterly review of AI usage policies and guidelines
- Annual evaluation of AI tool portfolio and strategy
- Continuous improvement based on team feedback and industry developments

### 📈 **Performance Metrics**
- Code quality metrics for AI-assisted vs. manual development
- Time-to-completion for different types of tasks
- Error rates and bug density in AI-generated code
- Team satisfaction and productivity measures

## Training and Support

### 📚 **Required Training**
- AI tool usage guidelines and best practices
- Security awareness for AI-assisted development
- Prompt engineering and effective AI interaction
- Code review processes for AI-generated code

### 🆘 **Support Resources**

- Regular workshops on AI development practices

## Incident Reporting

### 🚨 **Immediate Reporting Required**
- Suspected security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code
- Accidental sharing of proprietary information with AI services
- AI tool malfunctions that affect code quality
- Suspected AI-generated code that violates licensing terms

### 📋 **Incident Response Process**
1. Immediate containment and assessment
2. Notification of security team and team lead
3. Root cause analysis and corrective actions
4. Documentation and lessons learned
5. Policy updates if necessary

## Policy Updates

This policy will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect:
- New AI tools and technologies
- Evolving security requirements
- Team feedback and lessons learned
