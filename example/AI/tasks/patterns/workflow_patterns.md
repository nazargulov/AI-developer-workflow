# Common AI Development Patterns

## Workflow Pattern 1: Explore → Plan → Code → Review

### When to Use
- Complex features with multiple components
- New functionality requiring architectural decisions
- Tasks involving integration with existing systems
- Features with significant business logic

### Implementation Steps
1. **Explore Phase**
   - Load relevant AI/docs context
   - Analyze existing codebase patterns
   - Identify integration points and dependencies
   - Assess complexity and risks

2. **Plan Phase**
   - Break down into 20-30% automatable subtasks
   - Define implementation strategy
   - Identify testing requirements
   - Plan rollout and validation steps

3. **Code Phase**
   - Implement incrementally with AI assistance
   - Follow established patterns and conventions
   - Test each component as built
   - Document AI usage and modifications

4. **Review Phase**
   - Self-review using AI/code-review process
   - Validate against business requirements
   - Performance and security assessment
   - Team review and approval

### Success Metrics
- 60-80% of planning completed in exploration
- Clear implementation roadmap
- Reduced development time by 25-40%
- High code quality maintained

## Workflow Pattern 2: Prototype → Rewrite → Improve

### When to Use
- Experimental features or POCs
- Unfamiliar technology or domain
- Research and development tasks
- Learning new patterns or techniques

### Implementation Steps
1. **Prototype Phase**
   - Quick AI-assisted implementation
   - Focus on core functionality
   - Minimal error handling and testing
   - Goal: Prove concept viability

2. **Rewrite Phase**
   - Analyze prototype learnings
   - Design proper architecture
   - Implement with full quality standards
   - Apply lessons learned

3. **Improve Phase**
   - Optimize performance
   - Enhance error handling
   - Add comprehensive testing
   - Refactor for maintainability

### Success Metrics
- Rapid concept validation (1-2 days)
- Clear understanding of requirements
- Production-ready code in final iteration
- Knowledge transfer to team

## Workflow Pattern 3: Build → Integrate → Delegate → Iterate

### When to Use
- Repetitive development tasks
- CI/CD improvements
- Automation opportunities
- Tool and script development

### Implementation Steps
1. **Build Phase**
   - Create custom tools/scripts with AI
   - Develop automation workflows
   - Build reusable components
   - Focus on reliability and error handling

2. **Integrate Phase**
   - Connect with existing systems
   - Set up CI/CD integration
   - Configure monitoring and alerts
   - Test integration points

3. **Delegate Phase**
   - Hand off routine tasks to automation
   - Train team on new tools
   - Document usage and maintenance
   - Monitor effectiveness

4. **Iterate Phase**
   - Collect feedback and metrics
   - Improve based on usage patterns
   - Expand automation coverage
   - Optimize performance

### Success Metrics
- Reduced manual effort by 50-80%
- Improved consistency and reliability
- Team adoption and satisfaction
- Measurable time savings

## Context Engineering Patterns

### Pattern: Layered Context Loading
```markdown
# Primary Context (Always Load)
- AI/docs/main_context.md

# Domain Context (Task-Specific)
- AI/docs/[domain]_context.md

# Situational Context (As Needed)
- Recent related changes
- Specific component documentation
- Error logs or issues
```

### Pattern: Sufficient Not Excess
- Include relevant business rules
- Reference established patterns
- Provide specific constraints
- Avoid overwhelming with unnecessary details

## Prompt Engineering Patterns

### Pattern: Structured Request Format
```markdown
## Context
[Project and domain information]

## Requirements
[Specific functional requirements]

## Constraints
[Technical and business constraints]

## Expected Output
[Format and structure expectations]
```

### Pattern: Iterative Refinement
1. Start with broad requirements
2. Refine with specific constraints
3. Request alternatives and explanations
4. Validate against project standards

## Quality Assurance Patterns

### Pattern: Multi-Level Review
1. **AI Self-Review**: Automated quality checks
2. **Human Validation**: Logic and business rules
3. **Team Review**: Architecture and maintainability
4. **Integration Testing**: System-level validation

### Pattern: Risk-Based Validation
- **High Risk**: Security, payments, user data → Manual review required
- **Medium Risk**: Business logic, integrations → AI + human review
- **Low Risk**: UI, documentation → AI review acceptable

## Error Handling Patterns

### Pattern: Graceful AI Failure
```javascript
// Always have fallback for AI-generated components
try {
  return aiOptimizedFunction(input);
} catch (error) {
  logger.warn('AI component failed, using fallback', { error });
  return fallbackFunction(input);
}
```

### Pattern: AI Usage Documentation
```markdown
## AI Usage in This Implementation
- Code generation: 70% (with manual security review)
- Test cases: 90% (validated against requirements)
- Documentation: 85% (fact-checked and formatted)
- Manual additions: Error handling, business validation
```

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### Pattern: AI-Assisted Profiling
1. Use AI to identify potential bottlenecks
2. Generate performance test scenarios
3. Analyze profiling results with AI
4. Implement optimizations incrementally

### Pattern: Smart Caching Strategy
- AI suggests caching opportunities
- Human validates cache invalidation logic
- Monitor cache hit rates and effectiveness
- Iterate based on usage patterns

## Team Collaboration Patterns

### Pattern: Knowledge Sharing
- Document successful AI interactions
- Share effective prompt templates
- Create reusable code patterns
- Regular team retrospectives on AI usage

### Pattern: Mentorship Integration
- Pair junior developers with AI tools
- Review AI-generated code together
- Teach effective prompting techniques
- Build confidence in AI-assisted development

## Measurement and Improvement Patterns

### Pattern: Continuous Metrics Collection
- Track time savings by task type
- Monitor code quality trends
- Measure team satisfaction
- Assess learning curve improvements

### Pattern: Feedback Loop Integration
- Regular review of AI effectiveness
- Update prompts based on results
- Refine workflows based on experience
- Share learnings across teams
