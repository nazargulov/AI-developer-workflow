Perform a code review for the code changes in the code-changes.txt file (git diff format).
Focus only on the modifications shown there.

Your review should include:

1. ✅ Pros (up to 5–10)
2. 🛠 Improvement points (up to 5–10)
3. 📝 Summary of the overall quality (good or bad) with reasons.
4. 🧩 Alternative snippet showing how to improve the code, with filenames.

Cover these aspects:

- Best practices, readability, maintainability
- Intended functionality and performance
- Formatting and styling
- Architecture and design
- Naming of variables, methods, classes
- Comments and documentation
- Compliance with the Dev Rules below

### 🔍 Tests Coverage

Also check for missing RSpec unit tests.
List the names of the spec files or example groups that should exist, for example:

- spec/services/your_service_spec.rb
- spec/models/your_model_spec.rb
- spec/controllers/your_controller_spec.rb

> Do not write the test code itself—only the expected test filenames or example descriptions.
