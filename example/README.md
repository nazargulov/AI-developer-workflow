## 🔄 AI Workflow Patterns

### 1. Explore → Plan → Code → Review

**For complex features:**

- Load AI/docs context
- Break down into 20-30% automatable subtasks
- Implement incrementally with continuous testing
- Self-review before team review

### 2. Prototype → Rewrite → Improve

**For experimental work:**

- Quick AI-assisted prototyping
- Learn and iterate
- Rebuild with production quality

### 3. Build → Integrate → Delegate → Iterate

**For automation:**

- Create tools with AI assistance
- Integrate into development workflow
- Delegate repetitive tasks
- Continuous improvement

## 🛠️ Available Commands

```bash
# Development workflow
make setup          # Set up development environment
make test           # Run tests
make lint           # Code quality checks
make ai-review      # AI-assisted code review

# AI workflow helpers
make workflow-explore   # Start explore phase
make workflow-plan     # Start planning phase
make workflow-code     # Start coding phase
make workflow-review   # Start review phase

# Docker development
make docker-build   # Build development image
make docker-run     # Run in container
```

## 📊 Real Implementation Results

Based on our team's implementation with 43 developers:

- **81%** satisfied with AI tools (rating 4-5 out of 5)

- **84%** use AI for code generation
- **70%** want AI review in merge requests

**Popular tools:** ChatGPT (86%), Cursor (67%), GitHub Copilot (21%)

## 🎯 Context Engineering

This project demonstrates the three pillars of AI Engineering:

### 1. Context Engineering

- AI/docs structure provides sufficient, not excess context
- Domain-specific context files for targeted assistance
- Clear project patterns and architectural guidelines

### 2. Prompt Engineering

- Documented effective prompts in AI/prompts/
- Structured request formats for consistent results
- Iterative refinement patterns

### 3. Workflow Engineering

- Systematic approaches for different task types
- Balance between Human Control ↔ AI Agent Control
- Measurable productivity improvements

## 🔍 Code Review Process

### Multi-Level AI Review:

1. **Self-Review (Local):** Use AI/code-review templates
2. **CI Integration:** Diff Critic with context providers
3. **Team Review:** Human oversight and final decisions

### Usage:

```bash
# Generate diff for review
git diff main -- '*.js' '*.html' '*.css' > AI/code-review/code-changes.txt

# Run AI review
make ai-review

# Load context and template into AI tool
# Save results to AI/code-review/AI_REVIEW.md
```

## 📚 Learning Resources

- **AI/docs/** - Project context optimized for AI consumption
- **AI/prompts/** - Effective prompt templates
- **AI/tasks/patterns/** - Workflow patterns and best practices
- **AI/tasks/completed/** - Real implementation examples

## ⚠️ Important Principles

### Always Remember: **Git blame will show your name**

- You are responsible for every line of code, regardless of generation method
- AI is a tool to augment human intelligence, not replace it
- Review, understand, and own your code
- Balance efficiency with responsibility

**Formula:** `Context + Prompt + Workflow = Engineering`

## 🚦 Getting Started Guide

### Step 1: Environment Setup

```bash
make setup
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Workflow

- **New feature?** → Use Explore → Plan → Code → Review
- **Experiment/POC?** → Use Prototype → Rewrite → Improve
- **Automation task?** → Use Build → Integrate → Delegate → Iterate

### Step 3: Load Context

- Start with AI/docs/main_context.md
- Add domain-specific context as needed
- Reference AI/prompts for effective prompting

### Step 4: Develop with AI

- Use established patterns from AI/tasks/patterns
- Follow AI/rules/DEV_RULES.md
- Document AI usage in commits

### Step 5: Review Process

- Run `make ai-review` before submitting
- Follow AI/code-review/HOW_TO_USE.md
- Complete human validation
