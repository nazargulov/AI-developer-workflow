‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile            # Consistent environment
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # Human-readable project overview
```

**Key Benefits:**

- AI/docs provides targeted context for AI tools
- Replaces generic README with AI-optimized documentation
- Multiple context files for different scenarios
- One main context file for consistent AI understanding

---

## Slide 3: Instruments of AI Control

### Three Pillars of AI Engineering

**1. Context Engineering**

- AI/docs structure for sufficient, not excess context
- Code, Git, Docs, Rules, Terminal integration

**2. Prompt Engineering**

- Custom modes and variables in AI tools
- Documented prompts in AI/prompts/

**3. Workflow Engineering**

- Systematic approaches for different task types
- Balance between Human Control ‚Üî AI Agent Control

---

## Slide 4: AI Workflow Patterns

### Choose the Right Pattern for Your Task

**1. Explore ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Review**

- _For complex features_: Understand codebase ‚Üí design approach ‚Üí implement ‚Üí verify quality
- Used in: New feature development, architectural changes

**2. Prototype ‚Üí Rewrite ‚Üí Improve**

- _For experimental work_: Quick implementation ‚Üí learn from it ‚Üí rebuild with better architecture
- Used in: POCs, research tasks, unfamiliar domains

**3. Build ‚Üí Integrate ‚Üí Delegate ‚Üí Iterate**

- _For automation_: Create custom tools ‚Üí integrate with AI ‚Üí let AI handle tasks ‚Üí refine results
- Used in: Repetitive tasks, CI/CD improvements, tooling

## Slide 5: Development Cycle - Iterative Coding

### Continuous AI-Assisted Development

```bash
# Typical development loop
while [ $task_complete = false ]; do
  1. Write code with AI assistance
  2. Run automated tests: make test
  3. Check linting: make lint
  4. AI code review: AI/code-review/HOW_TO_USE.md
  5. Iterate based on feedback
done
```

**Key Practices:**

- Small, testable increments
- Continuous validation
- Self-review before human review

---

## Slide 6: Code Review Integration

### Multi-Level AI Review Process

1. **Self-Review** (Local)

   - Use AI/code-review templates
   - Validate against dev rules

2. **CI Integration** (Automated)

   - **Diff Critic**: Line-by-line comments with context providers
   - **Custom AI Review**: Comprehensive analysis

3. **Team Review** (Collaborative)
   - AI-generated insights
   - Human oversight and decision-making

**Diff Critic Features:**

- Context providers (currently Git, future: microservices + monoliths)
- OpenAI-powered analysis with custom prompts
- Automated GitLab MR comments

**Tools:** Cursor AI, Diff Critic, Custom CI integration

---

## Slide 7: Team Guidelines & Best Practices

### Development Rules for AI Usage

‚úÖ **Must Do:**

- Review every line thoughtfully before MR submission
- Document AI-generated code portions (1-2 sentences)
- Use self-review with AI before team review
- Check for built-in alternatives before adding dependencies

‚ùå **Avoid:**

- Blindly trusting AI suggestions
- Adding unnecessary dependencies
- Submitting unreviewed AI-generated code

üîÑ **Process:**

- Discuss controversial AI advice in MR comments
- Share findings in team chat
- Document critical prompts
